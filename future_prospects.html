          <p>For a long long time we moved around with the seasons. Sometime around 100, 000 years ago we know we settled in Southern Africa, then that stopped, then again around 50, 000 years ago we did again in Europe. Settling down is usually what is referred to as the beginning of 'Civilisation'. Really though, this term just refers to how to manage human social and cultural life under conditions of non-mobility. However, during the Modern period especially, but it existed before too, a great emphasis has been placed on the technical and archtectural modes of settling down, as if they in themselves were huge 'advances' in human capacities, or even 'being' itself. The social and political arrangments which are demanded by settling down look to the uninitiated to be 'natural' and 'superior' and even 'devinely ordained' to some. Non-mobility brings into being various types of social and political arrangements that are not useful, or desirable when moving around. The two modes of inhabitation have some common features, but they seem to require basic differences in social and political arrangments. The reverse is also true. So permanancy and sedentary living today, over time, appears to be the only way that is possible for most people to live. And if this is the way we conceive of ourselves, excluding mobility as a legitimate and useful option, then it appears natural, and even desirable to make decisions around making conditions stable. Stability looks to all the world like it is the aim of cultural life, social and political life. But it need not be so. Not if the conditions of existance now require a rethink on modes of habitation, and mobility.</p>
			<p>STABILITY is what has been the cornerstone of civilisation, and planning for how to deal with disruptions to that stability has been the core project of how we got here. However, by choosing STABILITY in the way predominantly the WEST has conceived it to be - with an overwhelming emphasis on large immovable built structures - the opposite has been constellated in the greater environment. We now have the larger EARTH systems moving into a period of perhaps unrecoverable INSTABILITY. It is important to understand these twin concepts, STABILITY and INSTABILITY, especially in the way montemporary Industrial Capilatism requires the former to construct conceptions of productive value.</p>
