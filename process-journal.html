                <p>After we evaluated our three ieads we dicarded the shared bus concept, finding it to be impractical as a service and too simple to iterate the required number of screens for the UI. Our mindmapping was applied to two design ideas, <b>Idea 1</b> which was the journey from the parent's point of view, the requester, and <b>Idea 2</b> the journey from the child's point of view, the passenger.</p>

Tese methods of group work were supplimentary to our in person meetings. These online methods do not generally work well for me as a designer, but we managed through some very tight scheduling, and sending images, and annotations back and forth. Collabortion is a keystone of large projects, and as with other design projects, developing UI for AVs will need a lot of testing to arrive at safe and accountable protocols and processes for them to be accepted by the wider community.</p>

                <p>Charles and Angi concentrated on the images of screens, and the presentation slides, while I reviewed and edited the earlier draft of the report. Editing was proceedural and I introduced phrases in bold text, so they would stand out. This was eventually used in the presentation slides so as to locate text on screen for whoever was speaking to the slides. Angi created the final report document, and the slides after we all made contributions. What was difficult was the communication at a distance, but we resolved to continue regardless of the limitations. Collaboration and professionalism are core design skills, with which much can be accomplished in a short timeframe.</p>

                <p>I had done some preliminary work on keeping some notes on the week by week decisions and activities for the journal, but underestimated how much time it would take to find a working computer in the Wilkinson building, which had all the licences for programs like Sublime, Sketch InVision and such. This was a minor factor but frustrating to say the least. I relied on help from tutors when coding problems arose, and all but a few were resolved.</p>

               <p>1. Compiling the process journal, though not strictly part of the prototype tasks helped to keep a tab on progrss and timing of our development process.</p>
                <p>2. Unifying the visual design was a process of early discussion, settling on colours and font, layout, margins came first. Then each <b>Amigo</b> doing some revision, the passing them on, and a final group discussion. Relying on each others strengths was welcome and helpful to a smooth process.</p>
                <p>3. As we progressed through the process, a key UI insight arose. This was that the Trip setup and settings, (not shown), were not something the requester wanted to spend time doing, in comparison with 'facetime, talk or chat' on the app. So deciding what information needed to go on what tab, became a priority, which allowed the elimination of another screen.</p>

                <p>Relying on fellow tutorial students to setup GitHub in quick fashion is a recipe for me not recalling later how to do it. During week11 tutorial time the <b> Amingos</b> were able to use the slikks and experience of <b> James Hunter</b> to do some imromptu Expert UI testing. James's comments were very helpful. Like referring to libraries of slider and tab visual forms already developed, which at the next stage of development would be cheaper than custom sizing.</p>
